# Multimodal Graph Learning Website

This website displays the information of the supplemental tablee for the paper "Multimodal representation learning on graphs"
It displays a table that outlines each step of the multimodal graph learning (MGL) framework and how different papers and application areas addressed these steps. This table is a living table, meaning using the form linked in the website we will add new MGL methods to the tables. This table is meant as a resource to those curious about using MGL for their application,, quickly directing them to the relevant resources on how to set up their MGL application.
